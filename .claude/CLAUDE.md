# Xenodot Forge — framework spine rules

Rules for working **on the framework itself** (the Node/TS web UI and tooling under
`ui/`). The game's own rules live in the game project, not here — see `plugin/`, the
**xenodot** Claude Code plugin the framework loads into every game session.

> Scaffold — expand with your own conventions. The essentials below match what the repo
> already enforces.

## Always

- Prefix shell commands with `rtk` (a PreToolUse hook enforces it; see `.claude/settings.json`).
- Plain JS + JSDoc only — no `.ts` files. Types are checked via tsconfig `checkJs`.
- Node/CLI scripts live in `ui/server/` so eslint's node group + tsconfig type-check them.

## Before committing

- `npm run validate` (tsc + eslint, zero warnings) must pass.
- `npx prettier --write` keeps formatting clean (lint-staged also runs it on commit).

## Layout

- `ui/server/` — Node server + CLI scripts (`setup`, `new`, `promote`, `doctor`, `materialize`, `update-badges`).
- `ui/client/` — browser modules. `ui/lib/` — shared JSDoc typedefs + helpers.
- `plugin/` — the **xenodot** Claude Code plugin: the framework's agents, skills, tools, hooks
  and knowledge base (`library/`). The single source of truth, loaded into every game session
  via the SDK `plugins` option (`session.js`) so games need no copies; terminal use installs it
  once (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Capabilities namespace as `xenodot:<name>`.
- `starter/` — the minimal Godot project + thin templates `forge new` scaffolds into a new game.
- Never put game-specific files in the framework; it points at an external game (default
  `../game`), reads it in place, and the game stays pure game.
