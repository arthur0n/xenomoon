# bypass the SDK's whole permission layer (canUseTool, permissionMode, allow rules),
# so it holds even under acceptEdits / bypassPermissions and for cheaper models.
# Git-specific destruction has its own guard (block-destructive-git.sh); this covers
# the rest. Keep the patterns high-signal so ordinary work (builds, tools/validate.sh,
# $GODOT --headless …) is never blocked.
