# scene feedback (render frame + capture run output) — tool definition

**Problem** — the gap an agent flagged: after a `godot-dev`/`godot-refactor`/asset-wiring change to a scene, material, or texture-import, the agent cannot **see** whether it rendered correctly. CLAUDE.md forbids trusting the editor viewport (it uses the editor camera, hiding camera/lighting/material bugs), so today the only confirmation is a human pressing F5 and eyeballing it. godot-verify layer 3 (`verify_render.gd`) already boots a scene, renders ~20 frames, and even saves a frame — but it is a **flat-color pass/fail gate**: it only writes the frame to a fixed, "do-not-read" path (`.godot/verify_render_last.png`), only on the success branch, and it surfaces _no_ run log. There is no single agent-invokable call that says "boot this scene, hand me back a frame I (or the orchestrator) can look at, and the runtime debug/error output of that run" — regardless of whether the render passed. That perception step is what stalls the build→verify loop on a human.

**Transport** — **CLI** (default). This is a stateless batch capability: boot → render one frame → emit PNG + log → exit. It holds no editor state across calls, never sets-a-property-and-watches-it-update, and never inspects a live tree without relaunching — so the MCP/live-editor escape hatch is not warranted. It is the same shape as the existing `tools/verify_*.gd` headless/windowed runs, in our grain, zero server and zero tool-schema cost. **A stateless CLI covers the need fully, so it wins.**

**Verdict** — **build thin.** ~80% already exists in `tools/verify_render.gd` (boots a scene, warms up frames, calls `img.save_png(...)`). The build is a thin wrapper + small lifts, NOT a new renderer:

- write the sampled frame to an **explicit, predictable artifact path** the caller is told to look at (`.feedback/<scene-slug>.png`), not the buried `.godot/verify_render_last.png`;
- save the frame on **both** branches (pass and flat-color fail), since the _point_ is to look at it when it might be wrong;
- **tee the run's stdout+stderr** (engine errors, `SCRIPT ERROR:`, `print()` debug) to `.feedback/<scene-slug>.log` so the agent gets the run output as a deliberate artifact, not a separate layer-2 grep;
- print one machine-readable line naming both artifact paths.
  No MIT lift needed — lifting anything here would be more work than the wrapper, and we own the result with no new dependency.

**Interface** — `tools/feedback <scene.tscn>` (a small shell wrapper; `<scene.tscn>` optional, defaults to `run/main_scene`).

- Drives the binary windowed (needs a display, like layer 3): `$GODOT --path . -s tools/feedback_capture.gd -- <scene>` (the game's `project.godot` display settings govern resolution — do not hardcode one), teeing combined output to the log.
- **Artifacts** land under `.feedback/` at the project root (gitignored, like `.godot/`): `.feedback/<scene-slug>.png` (sampled frame) and `.feedback/<scene-slug>.log` (full run output).
- **stdout contract** — one final line: `FEEDBACK: <scene> — png=.feedback/<slug>.png log=.feedback/<slug>.log (avg luminance X, spread Y)`; plus `FEEDBACK-WARN: flat color` when the spread check would have failed (frame still written, so the human/orchestrator can look).
- **Exit code** — 0 if a frame was rendered and saved (even if flat — that is a finding to look at, not a tool error); 1 only if the scene could not load/instantiate or no display was available. Distinct from `verify_render.gd`, whose exit code is the pass/fail _gate_; this tool's job is to produce the artifacts, not to gate.
- The PNG is **for an agent/orchestrator/human to look at** — unlike godot-verify, looking at the frame is the whole point. Do not read levels/entity scenes that have no own camera (the entry scene provides it); run it on the game's main scene or a standalone entry-point scene.

**Discovery** — `tools/CAPABILITIES.md` now exists (the curated tool registry); **add this tool's row to it as part of the build task.** Entry line:
`feedback <scene.tscn> — boot a scene, render one frame to .feedback/<slug>.png, capture the run's stdout+stderr to .feedback/<slug>.log; for agents to SEE a change and read its runtime output (no human F5). Windowed (needs display).`
`--help` text: `tools/feedback [scene.tscn] — render one frame + capture run output for an agent to inspect. Defaults to run/main_scene. Writes .feedback/<slug>.png and .feedback/<slug>.log. Needs a display (a window flashes briefly). Exit 0=frame saved (look at it), 1=scene failed to load / no display.`

**Home** — `tools/feedback` (the wrapper) + `tools/feedback_capture.gd` (the op script it wraps — fork the proven sampling/warmup loop out of `verify_render.gd`; both write a PNG, do not collapse the two: verify*render stays the godot-verify \_gate*, feedback is the _perception_ tool). `tools/CAPABILITIES.md` (the existing registry — add a row).

**Build** — _one-line task for godot-dev/tooling:_ "Add `tools/feedback` (shell wrapper) + `tools/feedback_capture.gd` (lift the warmup/sample loop from `verify_render.gd`, save the frame to `.feedback/<slug>.png` on both branches, tee stdout+stderr to `.feedback/<slug>.log`, print the `FEEDBACK:` contract line); gitignore `.feedback/`; add the discovery entry above as a new row in `tools/CAPABILITIES.md`." Obey godot-code-rules on the `.gd` (typed, header, `tools/validate.sh` must pass) — never reference `rtk` inside the `.gd`.
_What godot-verify should observe:_ running `tools/feedback <level>.tscn` (via an entry scene that has a camera, e.g. the game's main scene) exits 0, writes a non-empty `.feedback/<slug>.png` whose sampled frame is **not** flat color, and a `.feedback/<slug>.log` containing the run's output; a deliberately broken scene (camera aimed away) still writes the PNG, prints `FEEDBACK-WARN: flat color`, and exits 0 — the artifact exists to be looked at.

**Consumers** — `godot-dev` and `godot-refactor` (see a scene/material/texture-import change without a human F5); the **orchestrator** (look at the PNG, read the log, decide pass/needs-revise); the asset-sourcing loop's gate-2 (confirm a wired `.glb`/texture actually renders). They learn it exists via `tools/CAPABILITIES.md` (the registry the self-improvement spine says every capability must register to) and `tools/feedback --help`; the routing row in CLAUDE.md ("render a frame, capture debug output → cli-researcher → `library/tools/<slug>.md` → `tools/CAPABILITIES.md`") already points here.
