// Autonomous Mode / Main Goal — CONCEPTION as a Workflow script.
//
// This is the same loop the in-session server timer drives (see
// .claude/plans/snuggly-watching-crescent.md), expressed as an explicit Workflow
// so the control flow is easy to SEE:
//
//   kickoff (evaluate → clarify → plan)
//      │
//      ▼
//   ┌──────────────── check loop (every cycle, until goal met or budget out) ─────────────┐
//   │  assess progress vs goal  →  dispatch next slice  →  record one-line progress         │
//   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//      │  (orchestrator judges goal achieved)
//      ▼
//   confirm with user  →  final report
//
// In the REAL feature each "cycle" is a 5-min timer tick that pushes an
// `[Autonomous check #N]` turn into the live orchestrator session — NOT a fresh
// agent like below. This script is the conceptual twin: one agent() call per role
// the orchestrator would otherwise route to. Runnable as a prototype, but the
// shipped loop lives in session.js, not here.
