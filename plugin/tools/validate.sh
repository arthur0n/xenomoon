# tools/validate.sh — the builder's deterministic gate (the `pnpm validate` equivalent):
# format → lint → parse(+warnings-as-errors) → scenes → scene-errors → smoke → runtime bots.
#
# Composes the shared check library tools/lib/checks.sh, so validate.sh (the builder's floor) and
# playgrade.sh (the evaluator's rubric) run the EXACT same checks with no drift. This is the
# generic floor: a game adds its own project-specific steps (e.g. a named-clash lint over its own
# scene list) by calling more check_* / its own commands below the marked section.
#
# Usage (from the project root or anywhere):
#   tools/validate.sh                              # runs main scene
#   tools/validate.sh levels/open_world.tscn       # runs given scene
# Exit 0 = gate passed ("validate: OK").
