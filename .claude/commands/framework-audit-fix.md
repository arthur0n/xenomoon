# Apply framework-audit fixes — only the ids the human agreed

FIRST load CAVEMAN and acknowledge to the user.
The companion to `/framework-audit`. The audit **reports**; this command **acts**, on exactly
the findings you name. It never invents new findings, never fixes an id you didn't pass, and
never deletes/overwrites beyond the recorded fix. Run it caveman.

## Inputs

- `$ARGUMENTS` = finding ids to apply: `D2-greybox,D1-combat` (comma or space separated).
- `all-agreed` = every ledger finding whose verdict is `fix-now` and status `open`. Still
  itemize what it will touch before applying.

## Where the data lives (repo-relative; cwd = forge root)

- **Ledger:** `.claude/framework-audits/LEDGER.json` — the SOURCE OF TRUTH (a `findings[]` array) for
  ids, fixes, status. `LEDGER.md` / `ledger.html` are GENERATED VIEWS — never hand-edit; run
  `npm run ledger` after any write. Schema: `.claude/framework-audits/README.md`.
- **Targets:** `plugin/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `plugin/agents/*.md`, `ui/orchestrator.md`,
  `plugin/commands/*.md`, the forge-local `.claude/commands/*.md` (the self-improvement commands —
  when a D7 finding targets an audit command itself), `plugin/library/{transcripts,verdicts}/`.
- Editing a plugin file directly **is** the sanctioned path for a general improvement
  (`plugin/docs/process/promotion.md`: "General improvement → edit the file directly in the
  plugin"). A skill stays game-agnostic; the game's own FACTS live GAME-LOCAL (the game repo), NOT
  in `plugin/library/` (it symlinks/ships to every game). `plugin/library/` is for AGNOSTIC records.
- **Search with the Grep TOOL or `/opt/homebrew/bin/rg` (full path), NEVER bash `grep`** — the `rtk`
  hook silently drops/mangles matches, so a rename/re-tag sweep done with bash grep WILL miss refs.
  Don't reach for `graphify query` for a fix sweep either: it stores STRUCTURE, not prose, so the
  literal string you're replacing isn't in the graph — it can't enumerate every occurrence. graphify
  is for conceptual questions; a fix's literal sweep needs `rg`'s completeness.

## Steps

1. **Resolve ids.** Parse `LEDGER.json` (a real JSON parse of `findings[]`). For each requested id
   find its object. If an id is missing (already resolved — applied findings are REMOVED, not kept),
   or is `later`/`skip` (not `fix-now`), **skip it and say so** — do not apply.
2. **Itemize before acting — and CHECK THE FINDING'S PREMISES against the repo.** List each id → the
   exact files it will change and the operation. A ledger row is an OLD claim about the repo, not a
   verified fact: before you edit, read the code it names and confirm each premise still holds (the
   surface exists, the data source it counts actually accumulates, the named consumer really carries
   that data). If a premise is FALSE, stop and re-decide with the human (`mcp__ui__ask`) — apply the
   corrected fix, and say in the report that you deviated from the recorded one and why. For
   destructive or wide-blast ops (a rename touching many refs, a file move/delete, an agent split),
   confirm with `mcp__ui__ask` first if available; otherwise state it plainly and proceed (the human
   already agreed by passing the id).
3. **Apply per dimension playbook:**
   - **D1 (over-cap agent → split):** create the new specialized agent(s) `plugin/agents/<new>.md`
     (copy a sibling's frontmatter shape + the caveman trigger line), move the sub-domain skills by
     editing each skill's `agents:` tag, and set each new/renamed agent's frontmatter `skills:` to its
     core + domain set. ALSO (don't forget — this is where the blast radius bites): add the new
     name(s) to the `BUILDERS` alias in `ui/server/features/skills/skill-registry.js`; and rewrite the
     genre/routing PROSE that named the old agent — sibling `description`s (godot-dev routing hints,
     player/visuals cross-refs), lineage notes ("split off from …"), and `set-skill-tool` / hook
     examples. `rtk npm run validate` (gen-skill-scope) catches the wiring; sweep the prose with the
     Grep tool.
   - **D2 (decontaminate skill):** rewrite the skill passage generically — strip it to the METHOD
     (no game/character/arena/binary names, no hardcoded paths). The game's specific FACTS already
     live game-local (check the game repo's `design/`/scenes FIRST); do NOT copy the worked example
     into `plugin/library/` (it ships to every game = re-contamination). Apply to agent prompts +
     cache namespaces too, not just skills.
   - **D3 (rename for honest scope):** rename the skill dir + `name:` frontmatter + title, then sweep
     EVERY reference with the **Grep tool** (not bash grep) — agents' frontmatter `skills:` AND body
     refs, the skill's `agents:` tag, cross-skill Requirements, `plugin/library/` records, game-repo
     files, and any archived raw file carrying the old name. Wide blast radius — verify zero of the
     old name remains. (For a PARADIGM-scope fix, don't rename: just tighten the skill's
     `description`/intro to declare its paradigm, e.g. "top-down/orthographic only".)
   - **D4 (add data-driven variant):** add the Resource / `.tres` / `@export`-driven section the
     finding named; keep the existing canonical path, add the data-driven one beside it.
   - **D5 (extract shared block → skill):** for CROSS-agent duplication — create the new shared skill
     (`agents:` = the consuming agents), add it to each agent's frontmatter `skills:` AND a load line at
     conversation start (right after the caveman trigger, so it loads RELIABLY — not just listed), then
     delete the duplicated prose from each agent body. But if the duplication is WITHIN one agent file
     (a constraint restated 3x+ in the same prompt), DON'T make a skill — trim to a single canonical
     statement, KEEPING the fleet-standard intro + `## What you never do` scaffold (cut only the THIRD+
     echo, or the fleet's ~20 agents go inconsistent), and point the other mentions at the canonical
     one. "State each constraint once" means collapse the redundant echoes, not delete the scaffold.
   - **D6 (orchestrator):** apply the recorded edit to `ui/orchestrator.md` (centralize a
     duplicated directive, move dense prose into a skill, or trim).
   - **D7 (command):** edit the target command per the finding — a shipped `plugin/commands/*.md`
     or a forge-local `.claude/commands/*.md` (the self-improvement commands audited under D7).
   - **D8 (verification-flow gap):** apply the recorded edit at the named layer — add the missing
     `## Verification (mandatory)` block to the builder, wire the claimed step into
     `plugin/tools/lib/checks.sh` / `plugin/tools/validate.sh` (or correct the skill's claim), or
     replace a re-taught passage with a pointer to the owning skill, or REMOVE a redundant/superseded
     check whose job a live gate already does (an orphan `check_*` no gate composes and no skill
     documents, competing with the framework's own convention — e.g. the `smoke_*.gd` auto-glob) —
     delete it and confirm `rg` shows zero remaining refs. A new gate check graduates as a
     `check_*` function in `plugin/tools/lib/checks.sh`.
   - **D9 (harness simplification):** **strip** — apply the agreed removal/down-tier (edit the
     agent's `model:` / skill list, trim the scaffold, drop the dead gate step), then confirm the
     sample task + full verify still pass (a strip must not regress the gate). Deleting a WHOLE agent
     bites two spots no gate guards: hand-fix FEATURES.md `## Agents (N)` count (validate skips
     badges — a stale count ships silent) and correct any SIBLING ledger row that counts/names it
     (e.g. `13 sonnet + 2 haiku`). Or **harden** — draft the named `check_*` / tool into
     `plugin/tools/lib/checks.sh` (or `plugin/tools/`). For a GDScript analyzer-warning gap
     (SHADOWED*\*, CONFUSABLE*_, UNSAFE\__, etc.), the canonical harden is NOT a bespoke `check_*`
     that re-implements the engine — escalate the missing `gdscript/warnings/<name>=2` in
     `starter/project.godot`'s `[debug]` block so it rides the existing `check_parse` /
     `check_warnings_config` machinery (like its ~19 siblings), and sync the godot-code-rules
     "Warnings reference" list. Reserve a bespoke `check_*` for gaps the analyzer can't express.
   - **D10 (split the fused altitude):** carve the GENERIC baseline out of the domain-named
     capability into its own neutral capability (skill/agent), then rewrite BOTH the original payload
     and any sibling to LAYER their domain deltas on top of the neutral base — never let one aesthetic
     depend on another's skill. Fix the dependency direction: the generic core is the base both import;
     the payload shrinks to a thin filter/material/tuning delta. Confirm the second-domain read still
     holds (the generic half applies with the payload stripped) and full verify stays green. BLAST
     RADIUS the split bites beyond the skill prose: (a) a runtime skill-scope carve-out may exist
     PRECISELY for the inversion you're fixing (`STYLE_PIXEL_KEEP_ALWAYS` in
     `ui/server/features/skills/skill-scope.js` + its `skill-scope.check.js` tests) — re-derive which
     entries the always-kept neutral base now covers and prune/rewrite the comment; (b) new base skills
     are new frontmatter entries — check `BUILDER_INDEX_CAP` before adding both to an at-cap builder,
     else tag the base to a lighter agent and let the builder load it on-demand via the deltas'
     `## Requirements` (the `godot-3d-pixelation` precedent). Unlike D3 this is NOT a rename: sweep only
     refs to NEUTRAL content that MOVED to the base; leave valid domain-named refs intact.
4. **Verify.** If any framework file changed: `rtk npm run validate` (tsc + eslint, zero
   warnings — this also runs the skill-scope check, catching D1/D3/D5 wiring mistakes) and
   `rtk npx prettier --write` on the touched files. Report the result honestly; if validate
   fails, first confirm the failure is YOURS before acting — attribute red to your id only after
   checking it against the pre-edit state (`git stash`, re-run, or scope the failing files to what
   the finding touched). A pre-existing red from unrelated uncommitted WIP (a doc-only fix can't
   trip tsc/eslint) is NOT yours to fix or revert — say so and leave it. If the red IS yours, fix
   or revert that id and say so — never leave a gate red that your change caused.
5. **Record — REMOVE, don't stamp.** DELETE each applied id's object from `LEDGER.json`'s `findings[]`
   (match by `id`) — do NOT mark it `done <YYYY-MM-DD>` (git + this run's commit message are the "what
   was fixed" record, so the ledger stays lean — no `done` findings accumulate as distraction). If it
   clears the LAST `open`/`fix-now` finding anywhere in the ledger (the whole backlog is resolved),
   set `lastAudit` to a fresh one-line summary. Leave `later`/`skip` and un-applied findings untouched.
   Then run `npm run ledger` to regenerate `LEDGER.md` / `ledger.html` (never hand-edit those).
6. **Self-critique (in a subagent).** This is self-improvement — improve the loop, not just the fix.
   Dispatch this critique to a throwaway subagent so its reasoning never becomes main-window context
   debt: hand it the run's notes and have it flag anything that tripped the apply (a dimension
   playbook that misfit the finding, a blast-radius ref the playbook forgot, an ambiguous ledger
   field, a step that didn't pay off), and if a fix to THIS command or a dimension playbook is
   obvious and safe apply it there. It RETURNS ONLY the one-line verdict. Since this command REMOVES
   rows (no entry to hold a `Process note`), carry that one line into the run's report + commit
   message instead. Keep the verdict, not the critique transcript.
7. **Report — terse.** Per id: applied / skipped (+why), files changed, validate result, plus any
   self-critique note from step 6. This per-id summary IS the fix record now that rows are removed —
   carry it into the commit message (git, not the ledger, is the changelog; no separate changelog
   needed). End with anything still `open` the human may want next.

## Do this

- **Apply only the ids the human passed** — resolve each against `findings[]`; if an id is
  `later`/`skip` or already removed (resolved), skip it and say so. Never invent findings.
- **Verify the finding's premises in the repo before you edit** — read the code the row names; a
  premise that no longer holds means stop, re-decide with the human, and report the deviation.
- **Keep the gate green — that YOUR change didn't break** — `rtk npm run validate` must pass for
  what your edits touched; fix or revert the offending id rather than leaving it red. But first
  confirm the red is yours (check vs pre-edit state / scope to the finding's files) — never
  misattribute a pre-existing red from unrelated uncommitted WIP to a fix that can't have caused it.
- **Keep skills game-agnostic** — strip any game-specific content to the METHOD; the game holds its
  FACTS game-local (`plugin/library/` = AGNOSTIC records only).
- **Search with the Grep tool / full-path `rg`** — the `rtk` hook drops matches from bash `grep`,
  so a rename/re-tag sweep needs `rg`'s completeness.
- **Prefix every shell command with `rtk`.**
