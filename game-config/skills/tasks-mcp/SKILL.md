# Tasks MCP — Plan & Scratchpad

`mcp__ui__tasks` is a persistent task board (stored at `.xenodot/tasks.json`, shown in the UI right rail). Use it in every run as:

1. **Plan** — add a batch at the start so the user sees every step before you begin.
2. **Scratchpad** — update `status` and `note` as you work so progress is visible live.

## Operations

```jsonc
// Add a batch at the start of your run
{ "op": "add", "tasks": [
  { "title": "Read design doc",   "owner": "agent" },
  { "title": "Build scene",       "owner": "agent" },
  { "title": "Run validate.sh",   "owner": "agent" }
]}

// Single add
{ "op": "add", "title": "Fix collision", "owner": "agent" }

// Mark in-progress (+ scratchpad note)
{ "op": "update", "title": "Build scene", "status": "in_progress", "note": "working on wall merge" }

// Mark done
{ "op": "update", "title": "Build scene", "status": "done" }

// Remove (when a step turns out to be unnecessary)
{ "op": "remove", "title": "Build scene" }
```

## Fields

| Field    | Values                                   | Notes                                                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`  | string                                   | Required; used as the key for `update`/`remove`                     |
| `owner`  | `"agent"` (default) \| `"user"`          | `"user"` tasks surface in the Get Assets / task modal for the human |
| `status` | `"pending"` → `"in_progress"` → `"done"` |                                                                     |
| `note`   | string                                   | Free text; use as scratchpad — visible in the UI                    |

## Pattern for every run

```
START  → op: add   (batch — full plan)
BEFORE each step → op: update status: in_progress  (+note if useful)
AFTER  each step → op: update status: done
END    → all tasks done; no stale entries left
```

## Rules

- Add the plan before doing any work — not after.
- Never leave tasks in `pending` or `in_progress` when you return.
- `owner: "user"` only for things the human must supply (an asset, a decision) — not for your own steps.
- Calling `mcp__ui__tasks` never pauses the session; call it freely between other tool calls.
