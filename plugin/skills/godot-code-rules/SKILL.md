description: Strict typed-GDScript rules (the tsconfig-strict + ESLint equivalent) — full typing, explicit return types, warnings-as-errors, size caps, file headers, @warning_ignore policy, gated by tools/validate.sh. Load BEFORE writing or editing ANY .gd file, when validate.sh / gdlint / gdformat fails, on a typed-GDScript error (UNTYPED_DECLARATION, UNSAFE_*), or when deciding whether code may use Variant, duck typing, or @warning_ignore.

# Godot Code Rules (strict mode)

GDScript strict mode = TypeScript strict, enforced by: `project.godot [debug]` warnings→errors, `gdlint`/`gdformat` with `gdlintrc`, and this skill for what no tool checks.

## The contract

| Strict TS / ESLint                | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Enforced by                          |

| **no-magic-tuning** (data-driven) | A gameplay/feel/tuning value (speed, damage, radius, duration, score, color, ramp endpoints, agent size, scale factors) must NOT be a bare literal inside logic. Put it in a named, addressable place — a `.tres` Resource field or an `@export` configured in the Inspector — and have code READ it. `lerpf(0.3, 1.8)`, `Vector3(1.3,0.7,1.3)`, `const _AGENT_HEIGHT = 1.8` inside a behaviour/util are magic numbers even inside a "data-driven" system. Exempt: true structural constants (array sizes, bit masks, math identities).

## File anatomy

Every `.gd` in this order (gdlint-enforced via `class-definitions-order`):

```gdscript
# entities/player/player.gd — player movement, jumping, and inventory.
class_name Player
extends CharacterBody3D
## Optional docstring for scripts with public API.

signal died                                  # snake_case, past tense

enum Kind { MESSAGE, INVENTORY }             # PascalCase / UPPER_SNAKE elements
const MAX_ITEMS := 8                         # UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
@export var speed: float = 5.0
var inventory: Array[String] = []            # public vars
var _gravity: float = 0.0                    # private: _ prefix
@onready var _mesh: MeshInstance3D = $Mesh   # @onready last, typed
```

- Line 1: `# <path from project root> — <one-line purpose>.` Always.
- `class_name`: required for entity/component scripts other scripts reference by type. Omit for `main.gd` and `tools/` SceneTree scripts.
- Indentation: tabs. Line length ≤100.
- Naming: snake*case funcs/vars/signals, PascalCase classes/enums, UPPER_SNAKE consts, `*`prefix = private. Signal handlers:`_on_<Source>\_<signal>`.
- Author data/config assets as typed `.tres` Resources.

## Inspector `@export` hints (complex systems)

Complex-system Resources/components (e.g. `CastData`, `HealthComponent`) SHOULD annotate tunables so the Inspector constrains them — prevents out-of-range/typo bugs and self-documents:

- `@export_range(min, max[, step])` on numeric tunables (health, damage, radius, speeds, durations) — slider + bounds.
- `@export_group("Name")` to structure a Resource/component with many fields into collapsible sections.
- `@export_enum("a","b")` / `@export_flags("a","b")` where a field is a fixed set / bitmask (`@export_flags` fits future ability/AoE layer-mask fields).

Keep plain `@export var x: Type` when no hint adds value — do not over-annotate. Use `@export_category` sparingly: it bleeds into child nodes in the Inspector.

**`@tool`** ONLY when edit-time behavior is genuinely needed; ALWAYS guard editor-time code with `Engine.is_editor_hint()` and assume no game state at edit time — an unguarded `@tool` script can crash the editor. Strict typing still applies.

## Escape hatches — exactly two greppable markers

**1. `@warning_ignore` — never bare.** Every ignore carries a one-line reason comment immediately above it. Type-boundary reasons use `# SEAM:` prefix:

```gdscript
# SEAM: duck-typed pickup — any body with add_item() can collect (godot-composition rule).
@warning_ignore("unsafe_method_access")
player.add_item(item_name)
```

**2. `# FIXME(agent): <what and why>`** — known deficiency left on purpose.

Audit: `grep -rn "SEAM:\|FIXME(agent)" --include='*.gd' .`

Block form `@warning_ignore_start`/`@warning_ignore_restore` allowed only in `tools/`, never game code.

**Typed ref vs SEAM:**

- Wiring **down** to known node (main → CameraRig, entity → its child): typed `class_name` ref. No ignore.
- Calling **across** entities at gameplay boundary (`body` from collision signal): duck typing + SEAM. Do NOT fix with `is Player`/`as Player` — coupling entities to concrete types is the violation (godot-composition).
- A node reference wired from a `.tscn`/Inspector **NodePath** is the one exception to "type it down": declare it `@export var x: NodePath` (NOT `: SomeNodeClass`) and resolve ONCE in `_ready()` — `@onready var _x := get_node(x) as T`. A concretely-typed node-ref export assigned a `NodePath(..)` in the scene resolves to **null** silently (see Error → Fix).

## Boundary with godot-composition

This skill = **mechanics** (typing, sizes, headers, naming, gate). godot-composition = **structure** (when to extract components, signals up/calls down). Load both when restructuring.

## In-editor linting (gdstyle) — advisory, NOT the gate

`gdstyle` (config: `gdstyle.toml` at project root; install: `tools/install_gdstyle.sh`) is the
in-editor GDScript linter: live, fixable diagnostics in Godot's bottom panel. It surfaces
signals gdlint can't — `quality/max-class-variables` (a god-class proxy), perf hints
(`allocation-in-loop`, `process-get-node`), and complexity caps. Works on Godot/Redot 4.6;
CLI-only on Blazium.

It is **advisory only**: in v0.1.7 a rule set to `"error"` still reports as "warning" and
`gdstyle check` exits 0, so it never fails a build — and a couple of rules are off because they
false-positive or duplicate gdlint. Treat `gdstyle.toml` as on/off toggles + caps; the blocking
gate below is what catches regressions. Full rationale + the promote-to-gate trigger:
`library/tools/gdscript-linter.md`.

## The gate — tools/validate.sh

Run after every `.gd`/`.tscn` change, before reporting:

```bash
tools/validate.sh
```

Steps: 1 format (`gdformat --check`) → 2 lint (`gdlint`) → 3 parse + analyzer warnings-as-errors → 4 scene properties (godot-verify layer 1) → 5 headless smoke run (layer 2). Stops at first failure; ends with `validate: OK`.

- Never weaken the gate to make it pass — not `project.godot [debug]` warnings, not `gdlintrc` caps, and not `validate.sh` itself (including the layer-2 smoke-grep exclusion list). `tools/` is the plugin-materialized gate (gitignored); a local edit does not commit and is overwritten on re-materialization. A new benign-noise exclusion is a deliberate upstream change, not something to slip into a feature task — report it as friction.
- Never pipe gate output through `rtk grep` — hides FAIL lines; use plain `grep`.

## Root cause + evidence — `validate: OK` is NOT proof a behavior works

A green gate verifies **load / parse / logic-smoke only**. It runs `--headless` with the DUMMY renderer: **NO GPU, no audio, no real-time loop.** So it CANNOT confirm rendering (a mesh/material actually draws), audio (how a sound plays), or that an AI/physics body actually moves. Reporting "fixed" off a green gate for any such behavior is a false claim — the failure mode that destroys user trust.

Rules for every fix report:

- **Name the root cause, with evidence.** "The gate passed" / "should work now" is NOT a root cause. State the actual mechanism (which value/node/signal/order was wrong) and the evidence that proves it — ideally a repro that FAILED before your change and PASSES after. No evidence → say so; do not imply certainty you don't have.
- **Separate "gate green" from "behavior verified."** In the handoff, explicitly list what you verified and HOW, and what you did NOT/could not verify headless. For runtime behavior, write `gate green; runtime UNVERIFIED — needs windowed/capture/playtest`, never "fixed"/"works".
- **Use the right verifier for the behavior:**
  - **Movement / nav / physics / logic** = NO GPU needed → IS headless-testable. Write a SceneTree smoke that steps physics frames and ASSERTS the outcome (e.g. enemy `global_position` moves toward its target). Verifying a poly count or that a resource loads is NOT verifying movement.
  - **Rendering (does it draw?) / audio (how it sounds)** = needs the real-renderer capture capability or a human playtest. Confirming a node exists / `visible=true` / a `.wav` byte-changed is necessary but NOT sufficient — say which you did.
- **Don't fix by guessing.** If you cannot identify the root cause with evidence, report that honestly and request the capture/playtest signal — do not ship a speculative change labelled as a fix.

Do NOT widen the `validate.sh` exclusion list.                                                                                         |
| `@warning_ignore("unsafe_method_access")` above `if x.has_method(...)` still errors                      | The directive binds to the NEXT statement; the unsafe call is the bare call INSIDE the guard, not the `if` line. Put the `# SEAM:` comment + `@warning_ignore` directly above the call itself (an early-return guard, then the ignored bare call), not above the `has_method` check.                                                                                                       |
| New `class_name` script / `.tres` has no `.uid` (missing sidecar after a headless write)                 | The editor importer generates `.uid` sidecars — a headless write without an import leaves them missing. Run `$GODOT --headless --path . --import` to generate them (`validate.sh` step 3 already does this). NEVER hand-author a `.uid` file.                                                                                                                                              |
| Out-of-range / typo value silently accepted on a complex-system tunable (negative health, absurd radius) | Annotate the numeric tunable `@export_range(min, max[, step])` so the Inspector bounds it; group many fields with `@export_group`. See Inspector `@export` hints above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `@tool` script crashes/errors in the editor (null game state at edit time)                               | Guard all editor-time code with `if Engine.is_editor_hint():`; assume no scene/game state exists. Only use `@tool` when edit-time behavior is genuinely needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Typed node-ref `@export var x: T` (T a Node class, e.g. `Node3D`/`PlayerHealth`) wired via `NodePath("..")` in a `.tscn` is **null** at runtime, no error — guard `if x == null: return` silently kills the feature | A concretely-typed node export does NOT auto-resolve a `.tscn` NodePath — only `@export var x: NodePath` (or `: Node`) does. Type the export `NodePath` and resolve ONCE: `@onready var _x := get_node(x) as T`. (Or assign the node by reference in the editor instead of a NodePath string.) The gate's `check_typed_export_nodepath` catches this trap. |

## Warnings reference (ground truth = project.godot [debug])

Escalated to error (2): `untyped_declaration`, `unsafe_property_access`, `unsafe_method_access`, `unsafe_cast`, `unsafe_call_argument`, `unused_variable`, `unused_local_constant`, `unused_private_class_variable`, `shadowed_variable`, `shadowed_variable_base_class`, `shadowed_global_identifier`, `unreachable_code`, `unreachable_pattern`, `standalone_expression`, `integer_division`, `incompatible_ternary`, `confusable_identifier`, `assert_always_true`, `assert_always_false`.

Deliberate non-rules (left at default 0):

- `inferred_declaration=0` — `:=` encouraged; inference is typing.
- `return_value_discarded=0` — fires on every `connect()`/`move_and_slide()`; no clean TS mapping.
