# Features

What Xenodot Forge actually does, as a capability catalog. For the philosophy,
positioning, and setup, see the [README](README.md); for the wire protocol, see
[`ui/PROTOCOL.md`](ui/PROTOCOL.md).

Counts below are badge-tracked (`npm run badges` rewrites them and cross-checks
the agent list against `plugin/agents/`; wired into pre-commit). The live source
of truth is the **Agents** tab in the UI and the plugin dirs
(`plugin/agents/`, `plugin/skills/`) — this file groups them so it doesn't drift.

## The pipeline

```
idea → game-designer   interviews you, refuses vague scope, writes a one-page design doc
     → godot-dev       implements exactly that doc — nothing more, nothing less
     → godot-verify    headless engine checks; catches what Godot silently drops
     → you             one look in the editor — that's your job
```

Design decisions move **before** inference, not during it. Push-back is the
product: nothing is reported "done" without passing real engine checks.

## Multi-agent orchestration (the Hive)

- **One orchestrator per session** routes and coordinates; it never implements.
- **Background sub-agents** — builders run with `run_in_background`, so you keep
  messaging the Hive while they work; each can be stopped individually.
- **FleetView running strip** — one live chip per in-flight sub-agent. The client
  reconciles it against the server's authoritative running set, so a missed
  lifecycle event self-heals on the next snapshot (no stale cards).
- **Handoff-by-file** — a builder writes its full report to
  `.xenodot/handoffs/<slug>.md` (`gate` first); the orchestrator reads that file
  directly, so long reports never truncate away.
- **Persistent task board** — `.xenodot/tasks.json`, survives sessions and resume.
- **Concurrent-build hygiene** — every agent shares one working tree (no
  per-agent worktree isolation, by design: faster, simpler). The orchestrator
  partitions scope to disjoint file sets, re-verifies a transient gate fail
  during a concurrent build, and accepts the residual race rather than chase it.

## Agents (19)

Framework agents, namespaced `xenodot:<name>`. Grouped by role:

- **Design & scope** — `game-designer` (the entry point: interviews, locks a
  design doc), `level-designer` (reads a drawn grid, briefs a level concept-first).
- **Builders** — `godot-dev` (core build/glue/export), `godot-player`
  (first-person + follow camera + animation), `godot-enemy` (enemy entities, AI,
  data-driven archetypes), `godot-weapons-abilities` (weapons, projectiles, the
  data-driven ability/effect layer), `godot-vfx` (one-shot + looping combat
  particles), `godot-assets` (import/generate models & textures),
  `godot-visuals` (3D-pixel-art rig, lighting, post-process),
  `godot-refactor` (mechanical modularization into components).
- **Art direction & assets** — `art-director` (visual-style direction),
  `asset-advisor` (art-asset sourcing specs + post-upload verification).
- **Researchers (pull-based growth, human-gated)** — `addon-researcher`
  (buy-vs-build for free Godot addons), `skill-researcher` (find a skill when no
  `godot-*` one fits), `cli-researcher` (new agent/tooling capabilities),
  `transcript-researcher` (harvest video knowledge into the library),
  `godot-docs-evangelist` (authoritative API verification; needs the docs MCP).
- **Evaluation & support** — `godot-playtester` (the embodied evaluator: plays
  the build via adversarial bots + the playgrade grader, never fixes it),
  `bug-triage` (root-cause + what the framework should learn).

## Skills (50)

Procedures (one canonical path, observable outcome), not references. Loaded by
the implementers that own them, not invoked directly. Across these domains:

- **Meta / procedural** — `agent-report`, `autonomous-main-goal`, `caveman`,
  `graphify`, `research-presenting`, `tasks-mcp`.
- **Godot core** — project baseline (agnostic quality gates + way-of-work; game
  aesthetics live in a project-local game-conventions skill it teaches you to
  author), typed-GDScript code rules, composition (SOLID via component nodes),
  data-driven + effect composition, main-scene shell, docs lookup, export builds.
- **Verification & playtesting** — `godot-verify`, runtime smoke, runtime
  arena, the playgrade grader, the playthrough input-bot, enemy-AI headless smoke.
- **Rendering & visuals** — 3D pixelation (SubViewport), pixel-readability
  lighting, screen-space effects, orthographic follow camera, foliage,
  one-shot + looping particle VFX, art style.
- **3D mechanics & AI** — first-person controller, travelling projectiles,
  enemy AI (NavigationAgent3D + state machine) + enemy archetypes, shooter
  enemy combat contract, stealth perception, the 4.6 navmesh landmines,
  GridMap levels.
- **Level & spatial design** — greybox authoring, greybox-to-asset, arena
  spatial design, level-design principles.
- **Art & assets** — animation libraries, mesh/texture pixel-art + HD import,
  HD materials, procedural model & texture generation.

## Web UI

Runs the same agents from a browser (`npm start` → `http://localhost:8338`):

- **Chat** — composer + message history.
- **Activity feed + FleetView** — live event stream (tool calls, agent prose,
  transitions) and the running-agents strip.
- **Task board** — the persistent right-rail to-do list (agent- and user-owned).
- **Approval gates** — agent questions render as clickable choices
  (`AskUserQuestion`), typed **forms** (`mcp__ui__form`), and tool calls as
  allow/deny cards. Questions always reach you regardless of permission policy.
- **Promotions board** — approve/reject promoting a game-local skill/agent/tool
  into the framework plugin.
- **Sessions** — browse, resume (full context), and `compact` a session in place.
- **Settings** — Hermes, Codex, Godot-docs MCP toggles; model/provider; skill scope.
  **Set up** buttons run `codex:setup` / `hermes:setup` from the UI (restart to activate;
  Hermes still needs the one-time `hermes portal` browser auth).
- **Draw Level** — sketch a level on a grid; hands off to `level-designer`.
- **Get Assets** — request/upload PNG textures or `.glb` models; placed into the
  game (`assets/`) or the shared library (`x-shared-assets/`) and wired + verified.
- **Autonomous panel** — set a standing Main Goal and watch the check loop.
- **Project tree** — read-only browse of scenes/scripts/design docs.
- **Context meter** — live context-window usage (green→amber→red) per session.

## Verification & safety

- **`godot-verify` gate** — `verify_scene.gd` / `verify_render.gd`: scenes load,
  node paths resolve, properties aren't silently dropped, and frames actually
  render. Godot exits 0 on parse errors, so this exists because "verified" bugs shipped.
- **Validate gate + smoke tests** — GDScript lint/format checks and headless
  scene/playthrough smoke runs.
- **Playgrade rubric — 3 of 5 criteria live.** The playtester's grader gates on
  `runs-clean`, `core-loop-functional`, and (when a display is present)
  `renders-healthy` via the flat-color floor; `data-driven-adherence` and
  `feel-responsive` are declared but SKIP until they graduate to deterministic
  checks.
- **Typed-export NodePath gate** — `check_typed_export_nodepath` catches a silent Godot
  trap: a concretely-typed node-ref `@export` (e.g. `var x: Node3D`) assigned a `NodePath`
  in a `.tscn` resolves to **null** at runtime with no error — green validate, dead feature.
  Static check on the validate/playgrade floor.
- **Permission policy** — per-session, live-switchable: `ask` (default, every
  un-allowlisted tool prompts) / `edits` (edits auto-allowed) / `all`.
- **PreToolUse safety hooks** — guard destructive operations and protect the
  lint/config files; the `rtk` command hook no-ops safely if rtk isn't installed.
- **Auto-deny visibility** — a headless sub-agent's un-reachable approval is
  surfaced in the activity log (and a banner) instead of dying silently.

## Autonomous mode

A standing **Main Goal** plus a recurring **check loop**: the Hive evaluates the
goal, dispatches the next slice each tick, and reports progress — still gated by
the same approvals. Off by default; set/cleared from the Autonomous panel
(`ui/server/features/autonomous/`, `mcp__ui__autonomous`,
`.xenodot/autonomous.json`).

## Integrations (opt-in, off by default)

- **Hermes** — an external research agent with its own model/provider/billing.
  The Hive dispatches it for deep web research; it stays advisory (a Xenodot
  researcher + you own the verdict). Setup: [`HERMES.md`](HERMES.md).
- **Codex** — OpenAI's Codex reviewer plugin, on-demand only via `/codex:review`;
  credentials live in the `codex` CLI, never in Xenodot. Setup: [`CODEX.md`](CODEX.md).
- **Godot-docs MCP** — official Godot 4.x docs as an MCP source, powering
  `godot-docs-evangelist`; enabled in Settings.

## Digital-twin viewer (moved to its own product)

The digital-twin domain (IFC/BIM viewer, master-data binding, time-series
playback) grew into its own product:
**[xenodot-twin](https://github.com/arthur0n/xenodot-twin)** — forked from this
framework and kept in sync via its `/sync-upstream` flow.

## Growth loop

A new skill/agent/tool starts **game-local** in `<game>/.claude/` and is usable
immediately. When one proves broadly useful, file a promotion
(`mcp__ui__promote`); you approve it on the board and run
`npm run promote -- …` to move it into the plugin. **Tools carry a domain** — _universal_
(scene-agnostic; promotable, materialises into every game) vs _game_ (hardcodes a game
scene; stays local). A promotion guard rejects a game-domain tool so orphan bots don't
pollute every game — see [`docs/process/promotion.md`](docs/process/promotion.md).
Researchers write findings back into the knowledge base (`library/`, a symlink to `plugin/library/`).

## Provider flexibility

The Hive drives Claude Code through the Agent SDK, so **Amazon Bedrock, Google
Vertex, Azure Foundry, and enterprise gateways** are first-class backends (flip
the standard `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` / `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX` / gateway env
vars). Non-Claude models route through an Anthropic-API-compatible proxy
(LiteLLM, claude-code-router). You're tied to an API _shape_, not a vendor — but
the pipeline is tuned for Claude's tool calls, so non-Claude models lose some fidelity.
