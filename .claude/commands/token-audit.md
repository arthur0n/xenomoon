# Token audit — find agent turns we could make deterministic

A daily habit, not a one-shot. Each run mines a couple of session logs for spend we
could remove, records what it found so the next run skips it, files tasks for the human,
and critiques itself. You won't get it right the first time — that's expected.

## Why this exists

- Cache reads dominate a session's token cost. We just made the live meter count all four
  token classes (`ui/client/core/reducer.js#foldResult`) and added per-session cost to
  `/api/usage` (`ui/server/core/http/usage.js`) — so the data is now trustworthy.
- **Goal:** spot turns where the hive spent an agent/LLM call on something a script, a
  `tools/` entry, or a hook could do deterministically — then propose replacing it. Every
  such replacement is tokens we never spend again.

## Where the data lives

- Session logs: `logs/session-*.ndjson` (the forge's `logs/` dir; cwd = forge root).
  Filenames are ISO timestamps, so a lexical sort is chronological. The tag is the part
  between `session-` and `.ndjson`.
- Each line is `{ts, dir, type, message, ...}`. The signals you want:
  - `result` events → `message.usage.{input_tokens,output_tokens,cache_creation_input_tokens,cache_read_input_tokens}` and `message.total_cost_usd` (per turn).
  - `assistant` events → `message.message.content[].{type:"tool_use", name, input}` (the actual `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`/`Bash`/`Task`/`Agent` calls) and `parent_tool_use_id` (subagent nesting).
- Ledger: `.claude/token-audits/LEDGER.md` — read first, append after.

## Steps

1. **Read the ledger.** Open `LEDGER.md`. Note its `Covered sessions` list and prior
   `Process note`s so you neither re-analyze a covered session nor repeat a known finding.

2. **Pick scope.** List the log files. Drop any whose tag is already in `Covered sessions`.
   Take the newest **2** of what remains. `$ARGUMENTS` overrides: a bare number sets the
   count (e.g. `4`); a session-tag analyzes exactly that session. If nothing is uncovered,
   say so and stop — don't invent work.

3. **Analyze each log — don't slurp it into context.** These files reach several MB. Filter
   with `jq select(...)` directly — do NOT pipe `rtk grep` into `jq` (rtk's grep filter mangles
   JSON and breaks the parse). Look for:
   - **Repeated identical tool calls** — the same `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`/`Bash` input across
     many turns (context the model keeps re-fetching).
   - **Agent dispatch for mechanical work** — a `Task`/`Agent` spawn whose job was a
     structural transform, a rename, a lookup, or a check that has one deterministic answer.
   - **Cache churn** — large `cache_creation_input_tokens` repeated, i.e. the same prompt
     prefix rebuilt instead of reused.
   - **Costliest turns** — sort `result` lines by `total_cost_usd` (or token total) and ask
     what that money bought.

   Example sweep (adapt; `$LOGS` = `logs`). Filter the ndjson with `jq
select(...)` directly — do NOT pipe `rtk grep` into `jq`: rtk's grep filter mangles JSON and breaks
   the `jq` parse. Each log line is `{type:"event", message:{…}}`, so select on `.message.type`:
   - costliest turns: `jq -c 'select(.type=="event" and .message.type=="result") | .message | {cost:.total_cost_usd, u:.usage}' "$LOGS/<file>"`
   - tool-call frequency: `jq -r 'select(.type=="event" and .message.type=="assistant") | .message.message.content[]? | select(.type=="tool_use") | .name' "$LOGS/<file>" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`
   - **result-bytes by tool (the primary sweep — surfaces the real offender that raw freq counts hide):** map `tool_use_id`→name from assistant events, then sum tool*result char-length per tool. A tool with few calls but huge avg payload (e.g. an MCP docs lookup dumping 20k chars of \_immutable* reference per call) is the prize. Also: freq counts of Bash `.input.command` are unreliable — multi-line heredocs make `uniq -c` count physical lines, not commands; trust the byte-by-tool aggregate instead.
     `jq -rc 'select(.type=="event" and .message.type=="assistant")|.message.message.content[]?|select(.type=="tool_use")|[.id,.name]|@tsv' "$LOGS/<file>" > /tmp/ids.tsv`
     `jq -rc 'select(.type=="event" and .message.type=="user")|.message.message.content[]?|select(.type=="tool_result")|[.tool_use_id,(((.content//"")|if type=="array" then (map(.text?//"")|join("")) else tostring end)|length)]|@tsv' "$LOGS/<file>" > /tmp/res.tsv`
     `awk -F'\t' 'NR==FNR{n[$1]=$2;next}{k=n[$1];k=(k==""?"?":k);t[k]+=$2;c[k]++}END{for(x in t)printf "%-30s calls=%-5d chars=%d avg=%d\n",x,c[x],t[x],t[x]/c[x]}' /tmp/ids.tsv /tmp/res.tsv | sort -t= -k3 -rn`

4. **Judge opportunities.** For each pattern, ask: _could this run without a model?_ If yes,
   name it concretely — the operation, its rough token/$ cost over the sessions seen, and the
   deterministic replacement (script / `tools/` entry / hook). Discard anything that genuinely
   needs judgment; a false "make it deterministic" is worse than silence.
   - **Check the token MECHANISM, not just the call count.** Tokens are the PAYLOAD that enters
     context, not the number of calls. Fewer calls ≠ fewer tokens if each call returns the same
     bytes — a memo/cache that re-returns an identical payload saves latency, NOT tokens. To move
     the metric the replacement must shrink the payload (smaller/filtered result), DEDUP it (return
     a stub on a repeat), or stop it re-entering context. (Learned from `godot-docs-memoize`:
     "memoize get_class" was mis-scoped — a cache hit still re-dumps 20k chars; the real fix was a
     canUseTool dedup that denies the repeat.)

5. **Record — super brief (prose) + deterministic numbers.**
   - Prose: append ONE entry to `LEDGER.md` (template at the top of that file) and add each
     analyzed tag to `Covered sessions`. Most-important offenders only; scannable; no essays.
   - Numbers: capture the run in the PERMANENT time-series — the numbers come from the SCRIPT,
     not a prose guess:
     `node ui/server/cli/token-history.js append --sessions <tag,tag,…> --offender "<top offender>" --opp <opp-id>:<estTok> --note "<one line>"`
     (repeat `--opp` per opportunity; `--date` defaults to today). This writes `history.json` and
     regenerates `history.md`. See `.claude/token-audits/README.md` for the loop + file roles.

6. **File a task per real opportunity.** `mcp__ui__tasks` with
   `{ "op": "add", "tasks": [ { "title": "<deterministic fix in one line>", "owner": "user", "note": "<the agent call it replaces + rough saving>" } ] }`.
   `owner: "user"` so it persists for the human (don't `complete_open` these). Put the
   returned task id in the ledger entry's `Opportunity` line — and use that SAME id as the
   `--opp <id>` in step 5 so the task, the ledger, and `history.json` all key off one id (the
   human later applies it with `/token-audit-fix <id>`). **Fallback:** `mcp__ui__tasks` only
   exists inside a forge web session — from a plain terminal run it's unavailable. Then record
   the task inline in the ledger entry (a `**TASK (owner:user)**:` line) and say so.

7. **Adapt on the trend, then critique the process.** This is self-improvement — improve the
   loop, not just the game.
   - Adapt: read the last few `history.json` records (or `history.md`). Note the `global.hitRate`
     / `$/turn` trend, and for any prior opportunity now `landed` check whether it `moved` — a
     `moved:false` says the last fix didn't pay off; factor that into what you propose next. This
     is the loop learning from its own objective signal, independent of the framework.
   - Critique: suggest fixes to THIS command, the CLI, or the ledger/history format (confusing
     wording, a missing reference, a better signal, a step that didn't pay off). Record it as the
     entry's `Process note` (or `none`). If a fix is obvious and safe, make it.

8. **Return.** Super-brief to the user: sessions covered, the single top offender, tasks filed,
   and one line on the trend. To APPLY an opportunity, point them at `/token-audit-fix <id>`.

## Domain separation (positive rule)

- Token findings live ONLY in the token loop: `LEDGER.md` + `history.json` + `mcp__ui__tasks`.
  The two self-improvement loops link by REFERENCE, never auto-route.
- If a session reveals a framework-quality issue (a convention/agent/skill defect, not a spend
  pattern), hand it to the human to file on `.claude/framework-audits/LEDGER.json` — manual only.

## Never

- Re-analyze a session already in `Covered sessions`.
- Read whole multi-MB logs into context — always filter with `jq select(...)` first (never
  pipe `rtk grep` into `jq` — it mangles JSON).
- Implement the deterministic fix here — this command recommends and files tasks; the human
  decides. (Step 7's process tweaks to the command/ledger are the one exception.)
- Write a long ledger entry. Brevity is the point — the next run reads this first.
