// Ask tool: an ASYNC human-gate for background workers. Unlike mcp__ui__form
// (which pauses the session until the browser replies — impossible for a
// fire-and-forget background sub-agent, whose tool calls have no interactive
// approver), this files the question onto the persistent board as an
// owner:"user" item and returns IMMEDIATELY. The user answers it inline in the
// UI; the orchestrator reads the answer on a later turn and relays/acts on it.
// Use it from a backgrounded agent that hits a human decision; foreground agents
// should still use mcp__ui__form (a real, blocking form) instead.
