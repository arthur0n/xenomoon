// Promote tool: files a request to promote a game-local capability (a tool, skill,
// or agent) into the framework plugin so every game gets it. Like the task tool it
// does NOT pause — it records the request in the deterministic promotions manifest
// (promotions-store.js), broadcasts the new list to the UI (where the user
// approves/rejects), and returns immediately. The actual file move happens later,
// out of band, via `npm run promote -- --pending`. Authoring stays game-local by
// default; this is how the deliberate, human-gated globalization gets TRACKED
// instead of living in the conversation.
