// set_skill tool: assign / unassign a FRAMEWORK skill to an agent's index, when the user asks the
// hive to recalibrate ("give the builder the accessibility-audit skill"). It edits the framework registry — the
// skill's `agents:` audience tag (source of truth) + the agent's frontmatter `skills:` — so the change
// is real and version-controlled, and it applies on the NEXT session (the SDK loads agent frontmatter
// at session start). Deliberately NOT in the auto-allow set (unlike promote, which only files a
// request): this writes files, so it goes through the normal permission gate — the approval prompt is
// the user's confirmation of the change. Framework agents only; the hive's own skills are fixed.
