description: Orthographic Camera3D at a fixed angle on a pivot that smoothly follows a target — the default camera for top-down / isometric 3D pixel-art games. Use when a top-down/iso game needs its camera, the view looks distorted or "too 3D", an isometric/fixed-angle follow is wanted, or setting up a top-down POC scene. NOT for first-person/third-person genres — those use a perspective eye-camera inside the SubViewport (the pixel-art look comes from the downscale, not the projection).

# Godot Camera Rig (orthographic, fixed angle)

A pivot-based rig: `CameraRig (Node3D)` rotates to the fixed view angle; the `Camera3D` child sits back along the pivot's axis and renders **orthographically**.

Why orthographic is a hard requirement, not taste: with a perspective camera, world texels change size across the screen and per frame, so pixels shimmer ("pixel crawl") and the later texel-snapping fix is mathematically impossible. Orthographic keeps texel density constant, which is what makes 3D read as pixel art.

## Requirements

- `godot-project-conventions` applied (read `CLAUDE.md` first).
- If `godot-3d-pixelation` is set up, the entire rig goes **inside the SubViewport** (it contains the camera). If skills run out of order, build the rig at the world root and note in CLAUDE.md that it must move into the SubViewport later.

## Project conventions

- Scene: `res://entities/camera_rig/camera_rig.tscn`, root `CameraRig` (Node3D) with child `Camera3D`.
- Script: `res://entities/camera_rig/camera_rig.gd` attached to the root.
- Default angle: pitch **−30°**, yaw **45°** (classic 3/4 "isometric-style" view). 2:1 true isometric would be pitch ≈ −26.57° (`atan(0.5)`); offer it only if the user asks for strict isometric.

## Steps

1. Create the scene: `CameraRig` (Node3D) → child `Camera3D`.
2. On `CameraRig`: Rotation Degrees = `(-30, 45, 0)`.
3. On `Camera3D`: Position = `(0, 0, 20)` (pulled back along the pivot's local Z — distance is irrelevant to framing in orthographic, it only avoids near-plane clipping); **Projection = Orthogonal**; **Size = 10** (this is the zoom knob: world units visible vertically); Far = `100`.
4. Attach `camera_rig.gd`:

```gdscript
class_name CameraRig
extends Node3D

@export var target: Node3D
@export var follow_speed: float = 8.0

func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
	if target == null:
		return
	# Frame-rate independent exponential smoothing of the pivot position.
	global_position = global_position.lerp(
		target.global_position, 1.0 - exp(-follow_speed * delta))
```

5. Instance `camera_rig.tscn` in the main scene (inside the SubViewport if present) and assign `target` in the inspector once a player exists. With no target it is a static camera — valid for the first POC step.

## Verification checklist

- [ ] Camera3D inspector shows Projection = Orthogonal; parallel level edges stay parallel on screen (no vanishing point).
- [ ] Changing **Size** zooms; moving the Camera3D along Z does **not** change framing (proves orthographic).
- [ ] With a target assigned, moving the target makes the view glide after it without rotation drift.
- [ ] Pivot rotation lives on `CameraRig`, Camera3D's own rotation stays `(0,0,0)`.
