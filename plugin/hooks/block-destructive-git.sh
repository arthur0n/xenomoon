# PreToolUse(Bash) guard: block destructive / working-tree-discarding git for ALL callers
# (subagents AND the main session). A refactor agent once ran `git checkout <file>` + `git stash`
# to "clean the baseline" and destroyed an entire uncommitted build — this prevents a recurrence.
#
# Blocks:  git reset | checkout | restore | stash | clean   (also when rtk-prefixed or in an && chain)
# Allows:  git status | diff | log | show | add | commit | push | pull | fetch | switch | branch ...
#          (commit/push don't discard work; use `git switch -c` to create branches)
#
# Reads the PreToolUse payload on stdin; emits a deny decision (exit 0) only on a match.
