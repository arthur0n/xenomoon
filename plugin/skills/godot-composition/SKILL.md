description: Composition conventions ("SOLID translated to Godot") — component nodes over inheritance, signals up / calls down, scene as the unit of composition, and when (not) to modularize. Load before structuring an entity with more than one behavior, before any refactor/extraction, when a script grows past one job, or when someone proposes a base-class hierarchy or a shared-behavior autoload.

# Godot Composition (SOLID, translated)

Build entities by **composing small component nodes**, not by inheriting behavior. This is the Godot-native reading of SOLID: nodes are cheap, scenes are composable, signals are the interface.

## The rules

1. **Composition over inheritance.** An entity is a base engine node (`CharacterBody3D`, `Area3D`, …) plus component children (`Health`, `Hitbox`, `MoveInput`). Subclass engine types directly when you need their physics/rendering; never build your own inheritance trees for shared behavior.
2. **One script, one job** (single responsibility). The node name states the job (`Health`, not `Manager`). If you can't name it without "And", split it.
3. **Signals up, calls down.** Parents call methods on their children; children report upward only by emitting signals. A component never does `get_parent().something()`, never uses absolute node paths, never assumes its parent's type.
4. **Scene is the unit of composition.** A component used by more than one entity becomes its own scene in `entities/components/<name>/` (scene + script, names match). Entity-local components stay inside the entity's folder.
5. **Dependencies are injected** (dependency inversion). Components receive what they need via `@export var target: Node3D`-style exports wired by the composing scene — never by reaching into the tree to find it.
6. **Depend on signals and duck typing, not concrete types** (interface segregation). `if body.has_method("take_damage")` or signal connections — not `if body is Player`.

## When to modularize — and when NOT to

Extract a component only when one of these is true:

- A **second consumer** exists _in the current agreed scope_ (not a hypothetical one).
- A script demonstrably does **two jobs** (rule 2 fails).
- A design doc names a mechanic as **reusable**.

Otherwise: keep the simplest thing that works. Premature extraction is scope creep in disguise — a `Health` component for the only entity that has health is structure paid for and not used. The framework adds components **on demand**, via the godot-refactor agent, not by default.

## Anti-patterns (refuse these)

| Smell                                                          | Instead                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| God script on the entity root doing input + movement + combat  | one component child per job                       |
| `class_name Enemy extends BaseEntity extends …` behavior trees | components on a flat engine-node base             |
| Autoload used to share behavior between entities               | a component scene each entity instances           |
| Component calling `get_parent()` / `$"../.."`                  | signal up, or an `@export` injected by the parent |
| Extracting "because we might need it later"                    | wait for the second consumer                      |

## Refactor protocol (for mechanical extraction)

1. Run godot-verify first — the baseline must be clean before touching anything.
2. Extract: move lines, don't rewrite them. New API surface (names, signals, exports) is limited to what the extraction itself requires.
3. Re-wire via exports and signals per the rules above.
4. Run godot-verify again — both layers. The scene tree may change; behavior must not.
5. If the extraction requires a design decision (which parts are the shared behavior, what the component API should be), STOP and report the options — that judgment belongs to the designer/user, not the refactor.
