# Token-audit ledger

Running record for `/token-audit`. The hive's session logs are mined a couple at a
time for turns we could make deterministic (a script/tool/hook instead of an agent/LLM call).

**How to use:** read this file first. Skip any session already in `Covered sessions`. After a
run, add the analyzed tags below and append ONE super-brief entry under `Audits`. Keep it
scannable — this is the memory the next run learns from, not a report.

Entry template:

```
### <YYYY-MM-DD> — sessions: <tag>, <tag>
- Offenders: <top 1–3: wasteful pattern + rough token/$ cost>
- Opportunity: <deterministic replacement for an agent/LLM turn> → task <id>
- Process note: <improvement to this command/loop, or "none">
```

## Audits (newest first)

### 2026-07-24 — sessions: 07-23T20-05, 07-23T18-56 (stub 07-23T19-15 → covered, no slot; 07-23T16-13 left uncovered for next run)

- Offenders: **Read churn.** 07-23T20-05 is a big lexflow (webapp domain) coding session ($70–82/turn, 6 turns of pure cache_read on standing orchestrator ctx — inherent, not convertible). Payload leader = `Read` (393 calls, 2.19M chars ≈ 547k tok). Of 323 **full** reads, **156 (~48%) are re-reads of the same path with NO intervening Edit/Write** — identical file content re-entering context (allowance.ts 24 full reads / 9 edits, ai.router.ts, subscription.ts, docs/monetization.md 12 full / 3 edits, …) ≈ **218k tok/session** of pure churn. Bash (538 calls, 1.09M chars) is #2 but dominated by legit validate/build (`rtk pnpm validate` ×36, `build` ×17) + the issue-view jq comment-cap heredoc — not convertible. 07-23T18-56 = tiny (10 Bash, ~$1–2/turn) → no offender.
- Opportunity: **PreToolUse Read-dedup hook** — on a `Read` whose (path, offset, limit) matches a RECENT prior read this session with the file's **mtime unchanged**, deny with a stub ("unchanged since turn N — content already in context; re-read only if compacted") and log `policy:"read-dedup"`. Deterministic (mtime is exact), DEDUPs the payload (~1.4k tok/full read out of context), and COUNTABLE. **Scope to a safe window** (recent reads only) so post-compaction re-hydration reads still pass — a far-apart re-read after a summary is legit. → **TASK (owner:user)** [id `read-dedup`, est ~200k tok/session ceiling] — **APPLIED 2026-07-24** as `plugin/hooks/read-dedup.sh` (PreToolUse Read, WINDOW=20); landed `pending` — next audit counts `policy:"read-dedup"` × ~1.4k tok.
- Signal to instrument: `policy:"read-dedup"` once per denied repeat; per-event unit ≈ **1.4k tok** (avg full-read payload). Next audit tallies denials × 1.4k → hard actual.
- Pending re-check: `godot-docs-memoize` **RETIRED** (`moved:false`) — it dedups the godot-only `mcp__godot-docs__godot_docs_get_class`, but godot is upstream-only here and this fork runs webapp/app domains, so the marker can never fire in-fork → it was rotting `pending` every run, unconfirmable by construction. The agnostic form (dedup immutable external-docs re-fetches) ships as `read-dedup` for files; refile fresh under an agnostic id if a webapp docs-MCP ever needs it.
- **Rule (naming):** token-loop opportunity ids must be **domain-agnostic** — no engine/product names (`godot-*`, etc.). An engine-specific id in a domain-agnostic fork strands the opportunity as un-fireable. Name the CLASS of fix (`mcp-docs-dedup`), not the instance.
- Process note: Added a named "Read churn (no-mutation re-reads)" sweep to step 3 of token-audit.md — the existing sweeps (costliest/tool-freq/result-bytes) structurally can't tell wasteful identical re-reads from edit-driven ones; this offender only surfaced via an ad-hoc awk one-liner, now reproducible.

### 2026-07-09 — sessions: 07-08T17-28, 07-08T20-33, 07-09T15-44

- Offenders: **none convertible.** 07-08T17-28 & 20-33 are 6-line status stubs (no LLM turns). 07-09 ($27.5, 6 turns) is legit framework synthesis — transcript-researcher/skill-researcher harvesting 3 game transcripts into convention skills. Payload leader = `Read` (43 calls, 393k chars ≈ 98k tok) but reads are near-distinct (top repeat ×3, edit-driven) and no main↔subagent duplication; the 9 Agent dispatches are all judgment-heavy (draft/revise skills). Costliest turns = pure cache_read on standing orchestrator ctx ($10.2/$7.4, 600–800k cache_read) — inherent, same as prior audit.
- Opportunity: none filed this run — nothing here runs without a model.
- Pending re-check: `godot-docs-memoize` stays **pending** — 0 godot-docs calls in any covered session, so the shipped dedup denial fired 0× → uncountable this run. Next run with real game-doc lookups must count the denial marker and flip it.
- Process note: append CLI auto-computes metrics from `--sessions`; a run can legitimately file **zero** opportunities (record the offender="none" + note, skip `--opp`). jq `.text?//""` fails on the installed jq — **fixed** in `.claude/commands/token-audit.md:62` (`map(.text//"")`).

### 2026-07-08 — sessions: 07-03T10-35, 07-03T18-42, 07-04T22-05, 07-05T14-52, 07-06T07-39, 07-07T07-15, 07-08T06-40

- Offenders: (1) `mcp__godot-docs__godot_docs_get_class` re-fetches **immutable** Godot API docs — same classes pulled repeatedly across the 4 big sessions (Plane ×4, CPUParticles3D ×4, NavigationAgent3D ×3, Viewport/NavMesh/Camera3D ×2), each dump ~20.7k chars (~5k tok). ~11 redundant full-class dumps ≈ 55k+ tok of content that never changes within/across a session. (2) Costliest turns are pure `cache_read` on the standing orchestrator context (top turn $161, 384k cache-read tok) — inherent to long orchestrator runs, NOT convertible.
- Opportunity: cache/memoize `godot_docs_get_class` by class name (docs are pinned to the engine version — deterministic) so a class is fetched at most once; optionally return a member-filtered view instead of the full class dump. → **TASK (owner:user)** [id `godot-docs-memoize`, apply via `/token-audit-fix godot-docs-memoize`]: "Memoize godot-docs MCP class lookups (immutable → fetch each class once); optional member-filtered view. Replaces ~11+ redundant 20k-char class dumps/session ≈ 55k+ tok." — _mcp**ui**tasks board not reachable from terminal session; task recorded here for the human to file._
- Discarded (checked, not offenders): `tools/validate.sh` runs 63/196/96/21× but output is already compact (~72 chars, "validate: OK"/PASS lines) — no win. Heavy same-file re-Reads (outpost_alpha.tscn ×56, player.tscn ×50) are legitimate — files mutate between edits, so a re-read reflects current state; not deterministically replaceable. Agent dispatches (26–53/session) are all judgment-heavy game work (build FSM, playgrade, design) — correct agent use.
- Cross-ref: metric direction "tokens per **accepted change**, not total tokens" filed as framework-audit `D9-tokens-per-accepted-change` (numerator = usage.js; denominator = promotions.json/tasks.json). This audit's per-turn totals feed that ratio once the denominator is wired.
- Process note: `jq` tool-result extraction for Bash commands is corrupted by multi-line heredocs (uniq counts physical lines, not commands) — the reliable size signal is **aggregating tool_result char-length by tool name** (map tool_use_id→name, sum lengths). That one query surfaced the godot-docs offender the freq counts hid; recommend adding it as the primary step-3 sweep. Also: `mcp__ui__tasks` is unavailable in a plain terminal session — step 6 should note the ledger is the fallback sink.
