// rubric the audit used to eyeball by hand. plugin/ ships + materializes into EVERY game, so a
// promoted or directly-authored skill/agent/tool must carry NO game-specific facts. One scanner, run
// at BOTH seams so contamination cannot enter the spine:
//   • promote  (promote-run.js)      — hard-block a game-coupled capability at the game→plugin boundary
//   • validate (cli/gen-contamination.js) — catch capabilities authored DIRECT-TO-PLUGIN (bypassing
//     promote entirely, as the WIP enemy skills did) over the plugin's own skills/agents/tools
//
// Generalizes the old tools-only `gameDomainRef` (res://-only): now runs for all kinds and adds
// absolute paths, sibling-game refs, and provenance. It flags only DETERMINISTIC, low-false-positive
// signals plus a small explicit denylist of the CURRENT game's proper nouns — fuzzy proper-noun
// judgment past the denylist stays the audit's job (skills legitimately cite res:// convention paths
// like `res://entities/player/player.tscn`, so a blanket res:// block would flood false positives —
// res:// is checked for TOOLS only, where a hardcoded scene genuinely breaks other games' gates).
