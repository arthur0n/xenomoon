# PreToolUse(Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit) grant — let a SUB-AGENT edit project
# content + framework library without an interactive prompt. This is the lever that
# reaches a BACKGROUNDED (headless) sub-agent: it has no interactive approver, so the
# SDK auto-denies any edit that isn't pre-granted (SDKPermissionDeniedMessage,
# decision_reason_type "asyncAgent" — "Permission prompts are not available in this
# context"). A PreToolUse decision bypasses the whole permission layer (canUseTool,
# permissionMode, allow rules) for ALL callers — see block-destructive-shell.sh — so an
# "allow" here lands even when the SDK refuses a plugin's `permission-mode: acceptEdits`
# (the CLI drops escalating modes from a repo/plugin trust tier; see
# filterEscalatingDefaultMode), which is what silently broke background edits.
#
# Scope (kept deliberately narrow):
#   * Sub-agents ONLY — gated on `agent_id` (present only inside an AgentTool worker,
#     absent on the main thread; same field caveman-reminder.sh uses). The orchestrator
#     keeps its interactive approval policy untouched.
#   * `.claude/` stays gated — never granted here; config-dir authoring (skills/agents/
#     CLAUDE.md) remains a foreground, human-approved act (it falls through to the normal
#     layer → prompts foreground, auto-denies in background, as documented).
#   * Writes only under the game project (cwd), the framework library, or the shared
#     asset library ($XENOMOON_LIBRARY / $XENOMOON_ASSET_LIBRARY). Anything else falls
#     through to the normal layer rather than being broadened.
#
# Reads the PreToolUse payload on stdin; emits an allow decision (exit 0) only on a match,
# otherwise exits silently so the normal permission layer decides.
